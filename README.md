# Attendance System
The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is a Python project that uses OpenCV, Tkinter, and Pandas to automate attendance tracking through facial recognition. It features a user-friendly GUI for capturing student images, training a face recognition model, and tracking attendance. The system uses Haar cascade classifiers for face detection and the LBPH algorithm for face recognition. Captured images are labeled and stored, and attendance is marked in a CSV file with date and time. A password-protected interface restricts access to sensitive features like training and tracking. Unrecognized faces are saved for further analysis. While functional, the system can be improved by adding better error handling, optimizing file paths, preventing duplicate entries, and enhancing GUI interactions. Moving from CSV files to a database would also increase reliability and scalability. Overall, the project serves as a solid prototype for smart attendance tracking, combining facial recognition with intuitive user interaction.
